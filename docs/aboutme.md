# Who am I

I'm Corentin Meyer, I have a PhD in Biomedical AI and currently work as a Cloud Data Engineer at Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise. I combine both expertise in computer science (data science, AI/ML research, development and engineering and software development) as well as strong scientific expertise with 5 years background in biotechnology. I enjoy using my skills for health-related topics both as a biologist and computer scientist. What I enjoy the most is actually creating tools for non-technical people that automatize long task and make their life easier.  
I also love to do some teaching and popularizing science. I used to teach bioinformatics and machine learning (lectures and practicals) at the Biotechnology School of Strasbourg (ESBS).  

# Why am I doing with this

I created this place for multiple reasons:

- **Sea of complexity** - Whenever we are talking about science, code and machine learning, things are always presented in a complicated way. And I believe it doesn't have to be this way. I wish to present things in a simple and calm way.
- **Academic publishing is.. something** - I've come to the realization that I don't really like the way academic research is communicated. I want to have my own freedom to publish some science.
- **Creative space & Portfolio** - Building my own website allows me to have the full control on how I want to present things about technical subjects related to machine learning, data or biology. I also wish to use it as a portfolio for what I'm working on.
- **Teaching and popularizing** - Writing blog posts is also another way of teaching and popularizing science.

So... here are the reasons why Lambda Science blog exists.
