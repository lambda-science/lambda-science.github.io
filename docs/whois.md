# Who am I ?

Hi ! I'm **Corentin Meyer**. I'm 25 years old and a **3rd PhD Student in biology and informatics** in Strasbourg. I'm working in the _Complex Systems and Translational Biology (CSTB)_ team of the ICube Laboratory.

Basically I studied biology for 5 years and I learned programming and machine learning on my free time. I love having the **double hat of biologist and computer scientist** and I really enjoying using my skills for health-realted topics. What I enjoy the most is actually **creating tools for non-technical people** that automatize long task and make their life easier.

I also love to do some **teaching** to master student in bioinformatics, both as **practicals or lectures**

# What am I doing with this ?

I've come to the realisation that I really don't like the way academic reaserch is communicated. I find it is: too strict, lengthy, too much delay and the whole process just doesn't make sens to me (we have to pay to publish our own research ?).

I created this blog so that I could share thoughts, ideas and prototypes about technical subjects related to machine-learning, data or biology that I'm working on !

I feel like a blog give me enough space for the creativity I need and also an opportunity to keep teaching another way.
